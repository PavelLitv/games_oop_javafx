# Games in Java - Object-Oriented Programming with JavaFX

This repository is designed to demonstrate core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java using JavaFX through a series of popular game examples. The goal is to help developers learn and visualize OOP principles in action, from basic class structure to advanced inheritance and encapsulation.

## About This Project

Dive into the code for classic games like **Snake, Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe,** and **Pac-Man** to explore JavaFX's capabilities and understand how OOP principles can structure games effectively. Each game has been carefully crafted to illustrate specific OOP concepts, making it ideal for anyone wanting to learn Java through hands-on projects.
